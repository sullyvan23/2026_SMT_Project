#' Welcome to the SMT Data Challenge! Here are some functions to help you get
#' started. After you unzip the dataset, copy the name of the directory you saved 
#' it to into the 'data_directory` field below. After making sure you have the 
#' `arrow` package installed, you may call this file at the top of your work file(s)
#' by calling `source("SMT_Data_starter.R"). Then, you may apply functions and 
#' operations to the table names below as you would any other table and load them 
#' into your working environment by calling `collect()`. For an example of this 
#' process, un-comment and run the lines below the starter code. 
#'  
#' WARNING: The data subsets are large, especially `player-positions`. Reading the 
#'   entire subset at once without filtering may incur performance issues on your 
#'   machine or even crash your R session. It is recommended that you filter 
#'   data subsets wisely before calling `collect()`.

# Include the full file path to the folder that holds the data here!
